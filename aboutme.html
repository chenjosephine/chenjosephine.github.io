I did my undergraduate studies at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and my master's at The City College of New York. My specialization is in energy and sustainability, but I'm generally curious about many things and I love learning new things. In fact, I'm currently dabbling in data science. <!--include link here in the future to git repo for data science--></p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to pretend I'm the next Ansel Adams or Henri Cartier-Bresson, but my capabilities run more along the lines of "slightly trigger-happy child." I consume insane amounts of coffee and music (those are my main currencies). I love language learning (l'italiano adesso), bad movie title translations, and dogs. I'm always looking for the next way to contribute meaningfully to the world- I may not know everything, but I'm always up for <a href="mailto:jchen1114@gmail.com">new challenges</a>. </p>
