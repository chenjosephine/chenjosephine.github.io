        <p>Hi! I'm Josephine, a chemical engineer based in New York, NY. I did my undergraduate studies at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and my master's at The City College of New York. My specialization is in energy and sustainability, but I'm generally curious about many things and love learning new things. 
        I who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern backends.
